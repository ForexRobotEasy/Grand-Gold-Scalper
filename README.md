## Product Description

Grand Gold Scalper is an expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to analyze the forex market and open buy orders based on specific trading opportunities. The expert advisor is programmed to scan the forex market for potential trading opportunities and open a new order when a suitable opportunity is found.

The expert advisor has the following input parameters:

- LotSize: The lot size for trading.
- StopLoss: The stop loss in pips.
- TakeProfit: The take profit in pips.

The expert advisor works by continuously checking for existing orders. If there are no active orders, it scans the forex market for potential trading opportunities using the `ScanMarket()` function. If a trading opportunity is found, it opens a new order using the `OpenOrder()` function.

The `ScanMarket()` function is responsible for scanning the forex market for trading opportunities. This function can be customized to implement specific trading strategies or indicators.

The `OpenOrder()` function is responsible for opening a new order. It calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the input parameters and opens a buy order using the `OrderSend()` function.

The expert advisor also has additional functions for initialization, deinitialization, handling tick events, real-time data analysis, and handling the expert stop event.
